**************************************************************

Execution Instructions:
***********************
=> Please follow the below steps to execute the functionality.
	
	Step-1: Compile the code
					# make
	
	Step-2: Populate the sample file with username, password and allowed commands 			separated by comma
					Example: 
							username1,password2,command1,command2,command3
							username2,password2,command1,command2
							username3,password3
							
	Step-2: Execute the code
			=> Initiate the functionality as Server (Executor). On terminal execute the below command:
				
				# ./server -f <config_filename>

			=> Initiate the functionality as Client (Requester). On another terminal execute the below command:
				
				# ./client --server <server ip> --user <username> --password <password> --exec <program to execute>
	
		Note: Kill the server use "Ctrl+C" and then only close the terminal.
				
	Step 3: Cleaning the executables and output files.
					# make clean

Assumptions :
--------------------
	=> For --exec option : having spaced commands (ex. "ls -la") use quotes to enclose the them.
	
	=> Config File will have the entry in the following manner:
			username1,password1,command11,command12,.......
			username2,password2,command21,command22,.......
	
	=> Maximum Buffer size and command length can be changed using the global variable MAXLEN (in global.h)
